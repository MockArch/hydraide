# 🗺️ Hydra Roadmap

Hydra is not just growing. It’s evolving.

It redefines how data is stored, queried, and synchronized — combining the precision of databases with the flexibility of real-time processing.

Built on a modular hierarchy of Sanctuaries, Realms, Swamps, and Indexes, Hydra empowers developers to model dynamic data, perform powerful set operations, and subscribe to instant changes — all with a simple, elegant API.

This roadmap outlines what we’re building, improving, and dreaming about — together with the community.

---

## 🔥 Initial Public Release (Developer Edition)

> The first downloadable, installable version of Hydra, focused on developer onboarding and experimentation.

### ✅ Planned for Public:

- Hydrungo SDK embedded and preconfigured
- Initial documentation: Thinking in Hydra, Indexing, Locking, Subscriptions

### 🔐 Internal / Work-in-Progress:

- Authentication and access system (token-based)
- Version limitation / developer tier licensing mechanism
- Hydra license generator system for controlled access

> 🔒 Some components are internal, but the public release will provide a full sandbox experience for early adopters.
