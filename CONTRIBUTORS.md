# 🤝 Hydra Contributors – Shape the Engine of a New Era

> *You’re not joining a project. You’re helping define a new category.*

Hydra isn’t just a database.
It’s an **Adaptive Intelligent Data Engine (AIDE)** – a system that unifies search, memory, and messaging into one real-time, ephemeral, and elegant architecture.

And now, we’re inviting the bold to build its future.

---

## 🌌 Why Contribute to Hydra?

If you’ve ever felt limited by tools that:
- Need schemas before logic,
- Require daemons just to stay alive,
- Burn memory just to sit idle,
- Or depend on brokers for reactivity —

Then you’re ready for Hydra.

> Hydra is what happens when you start from **zero** and ask:  
> *What would data look like if it was built for real-time, multi-core, AI-native systems?*

We’ve already built the engine. Now we’re building the SDKs – and we need **pioneers**.

You don’t need to be a rockstar. You need to be **curious**, **intentional**, and **ready to build something that outlives trends**.

> 🙋‍♀️ **New to SDKs?**  
> No worries. If you’ve written APIs, built CLI tools, or just love clean code – you’re ready. We mentor. You grow.

## 🧭 What You’ll Be Building

We’re developing official Hydra SDKs across multiple languages.
Each SDK is:
- Idiomatic and clean.
- Inspired by our Go reference SDK (`hydrungo`).
- A bridge between Hydra’s core and your favorite stack.

You’re not wrapping endpoints.
You’re translating a **new kind of intelligence** into your language.

| 💻 Language | 🔗 Repo | 🛠️ Status | 📝 Notes |
|------------|--------|------------|---------|
| Go         | `hydrungo`   | ✅ Production-ready | Your blueprint. Dive in. |
| Node.js    | `hydrunjs`   | 🧪 Planning          | First-contributor ready |
| Python     | `hydrunpy`   | 🧠 In design         | Ideal for scripting, ML |
| Rust       | `hydrunrs`   | 🧠 In design         | Zero-cost performance  |
| Java       | `hydrunjv`   | 🧠 In design         | Backend-scale systems  |
| C# / .NET  | `hydruncs`   | 🧠 In design         | Unity and services     |
| C++        | `hydruncpp`  | 🧠 In design         | Low-level control      |
| Kotlin     | `hydrunkt`   | 🧠 In design         | Android and backend    |
| Swift      | `hydrunsw`   | 🧠 In design         | Native iOS/macOS apps  |

## 🔧 How You Can Contribute

You’ll be building from a powerful foundation:
- A full-featured Go SDK
- Production use-cases
- A clear, expressive gRPC interface

You won’t be guessing.
You’ll be **translating proven power** into new languages.

Here’s what contribution looks like:
- ✅ Write idiomatic wrappers around the Hydra API
- 🧠 Translate key helper libraries (e.g., struct ↔ key-value)
- 🧾 Build real examples for real people
- 🧪 Push the SDK with edge cases
- 💬 Improve docs, tests, onboarding
- 🌊 React to live data with subscriptions

You’re not just helping others use Hydra.
You’re showing them what it **feels like** to use it natively.
