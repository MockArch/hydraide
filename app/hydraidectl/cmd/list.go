		//  Then determine which ones are currently running, and which ones are stopped.
		//  (We'll need a lightweight utility that monitors processes for this.)
		//  It's important that we can also list the *name* of each instance,
		//  because the user will need this name to issue the `start` command.
		//  The `ls` command should simply return the list of instances on the system,
		//  along with their current status (e.g. running, stopped).
