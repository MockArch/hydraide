HydrAIDE License v1.0

Copyright (c) 2025 Trendizz.com Kft. All rights reserved.

This license applies to all publicly available source code and intellectual material published under the HydrAIDE project, including but not limited to SDKs, generated client libraries, tooling code, documentation snippets, technical descriptions, conceptual explanations, and support utilities found on the official GitHub repository (https://github.com/hydraide/hydraide), the official website (https://hydraide.io), and any affiliated online domains.

These materials are NOT licensed under traditional open-source licenses such as Apache 2.0, MIT, or GPL. Instead, they are provided under the following restrictive terms to protect the intellectual property, architecture, and functionality of the HydrAIDE engine.

1. Grant of License

Subject to your full compliance with this License, Trendizz.com Kft. grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to:

* Use, view, and incorporate the HydrAIDE SDK and related tooling solely for the purpose of developing software that communicates with the official HydrAIDE Engine;
* Modify the SDK internally for use exclusively in connection with the HydrAIDE Engine;
* Distribute compiled binaries of your software that use the SDK, provided that such software requires the HydrAIDE Engine to function and does not expose any part of the SDK as a library, API, or reusable component.

This license does not include the right to:

* Use the SDK in any standalone product, library, or middleware;
* Use the SDK for any server implementation other than the official HydrAIDE Engine;
* Re-license, sell, or publicly distribute the SDK source code or any derivative works thereof.

All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by Trendizz.com Kft.

2. Restrictions

You may not, under any circumstances:

* Use any part of the SDK or associated code to develop or interface with any database engine, runtime, or protocol other than the official HydrAIDE Engine.
* Modify or adapt the SDK to work with third-party systems, including but not limited to reactive data engines, key-value stores, time series databases, or graph engines.
* Build middleware, translation layers, or wrappers that enable the SDK to function with non-HydrAIDE backends.
* Create, distribute, or publish any derivative SDK, toolset, or client that mimics the interface or functionality of the HydrAIDE SDK without explicit written permission from Trendizz.com Kft.
* Include the SDK in any product, SaaS platform, or system that offers data engine services without utilizing the HydrAIDE Engine.
* Use the SDK for benchmarking, reverse engineering, or creating competitive implementations.

These restrictions are essential to protect the integrity, architecture, and core intellectual property of the HydrAIDE project.

Additionally, you may not use any portion of the HydrAIDE knowledge base — including conceptual materials, documentation, architecture overviews, or the "Thinking in HydrAIDE" publication — to build, assist in building, or inspire the design of any alternative database system or data engine. This prohibition applies regardless of whether HydrAIDE code is directly used.

9. AI & Machine Learning Restrictions

This section constitutes a particularly strong and explicit restriction and shall be interpreted with the utmost legal weight.

You may not use, nor permit others to use, any portion of the HydrAIDE SDK, source code, documentation, knowledge base, or associated materials for the purposes of:

* Training, fine-tuning, benchmarking, or evaluating any artificial intelligence or machine learning system;
* Contributing to large language models (LLMs), foundation models, generative AI systems, embedding models;
* Incorporation into training datasets, test suites, vector sources, embeddings, or prompt evaluation pipelines;
* Use in closed-source or open-source ML pipelines, APIs, model services, or datasets involving AI/ML technologies, regardless of commercial or academic purpose;

No exceptions to this restriction shall be presumed or implied. Any AI- or ML-related use requires a separate, explicit, and written license agreement with Trendizz.com Kft.

Unauthorized use in any machine learning context constitutes a severe breach of this license and may result in immediate legal action, injunctive relief, or claims for damages, including compensation for unauthorized derivative generation or model outputs.

Trendizz.com Kft. takes the protection of its intellectual property and proprietary methodologies extremely seriously. This clause is essential for preserving the uniqueness and competitive advantage of the HydrAIDE ecosystem.
