## Additional Terms and Conditions

This HydrAIDE repository and SDK are part of the **HydrAIDE ecosystem**, developed and maintained by
**Gebri PÃ©ter** and **Trendizz Systems**. It is designed to enable integration
with the HydrAIDE Core (search, segment, and data infrastructure), under the following terms:

### 1. Permitted Usage

You may freely use this SDK in commercial or non-commercial projects,
as long as such usage complies with the LGPL v3 license.

### 2. Derivative Works

Any modifications, forks, or derivative works:
- must be clearly documented and attributed,
- and must remain licensed under LGPL v3.

### 3. HydrAIDE Core Access

This SDK does **not** include or grant access to the **HydrAIDE Core engine**,
which is a separate component licensed under the **SSPL v1** with additional
custom terms.

You may use the Core in internal, embedded, or private backend systems â€” even for
large-scale or commercial applications â€” **as long as the Core itself is not offered
as a standalone service** (e.g. database-as-a-service, public API, or a rebranded engine sold under
another name /white-label product/).

Offering the Core or its core functionality directly to third parties **as a service**
requires a commercial license.

For licensing inquiries, please contact:
ðŸ“§ peter.gebri@trendizz.com

### 4. License Integrity

To preserve the integrity of the HydrAIDE ecosystem, users must comply with
the terms of this license and avoid any actions that:

- misrepresent the origin or authorship of the SDK,
- attempt to relicense or rebrand it as a different product,
- or intentionally circumvent the intended license boundaries.

Violation of these terms may void your rights under this license.
