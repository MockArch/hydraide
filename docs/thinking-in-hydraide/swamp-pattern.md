# 🌿 Swamp Pattern – Configuring Swamps from Code

Welcome back, HydrAIDE developer! 🧠

By now, you’ve understood how naming in HydrAIDE defines your structure. But structure is just the start.

What you’re about to discover here is how to **fully control the behavior of your Swamps** – not through dashboards, not through config files – but directly from your code.

Let’s unlock the *engine room* of HydrAIDE. No more manual DB configs. No more file system hacking. Just pure, programmatic power.

---

## 🧱 Philosophy – Configuration by Pattern, Not Admin Panel

One of HydrAIDE’s founding principles is simple:

> You should never have to leave your code to define how your data engine works.

We mean it. No CLI. No web UI. No external config files to maintain.

Every aspect of your Swamp – from **disk persistence**, to **memory lifetimes**, to **chunk sizing**, to **hydration behavior** – can and should be defined **within code**.

And because of that, each Swamp can behave exactly the way your use case demands.

---

## 🧪 Use Case Diversity – Not All Swamps Are Equal

Here’s the reality: not every Swamp is born equal.

Some store long-term user data.
Some are ephemeral queues.
Some are event buffers.
Some are real-time game states.

So naturally, their behavior needs to differ.

Let’s look at a few examples:

- **Swamps for real-time messaging** → don’t need to persist to disk at all.
- **Swamps for socket session data** → should stay in RAM but disappear after a few seconds of idle.
- **Swamps for user profiles** → should be saved to SSD, chunked, compressed, and rarely expire.
- **Swamps for telemetry data** → should rotate files frequently, with aggressive compression and TTL.

HydrAIDE lets you model all of these **without plugins**, **without extensions**, and **without ops support**.

## ⚙️ Deep Control – File Size, Write Timing, Memory TTL

Here’s a taste of what you can control for every Swamp:

| Setting | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔒 Max file size | Max file size per Swamp chunk – optimize for SSD health and append behavior |
| ⏰ Write interval | How often to write modified or deleted treasures from RAM to disk (in seconds) |
| 🕛 Memory lifespan | How long to keep a Swamp in memory after its last access |
| 🛠️ In-memory only | Whether the Swamp exists only in memory, without ever being written to disk |

This is more than flexibility.
This is *command*. 🧑‍✈️

## 📂 Smart File Handling – HydrAIDE Protects Your SSD

SSDs are fast – but they wear out.
Frequent full file rewrites can kill them.

HydrAIDE solves this with **chunked files** and **delta writes**:

- Each Swamp is split into max-size **chunks** (configurable).
- Only the **modified chunk** is rewritten.
- The rest of the file stays untouched.

This means if a single treasure changes, HydrAIDE updates just that block – not the whole swamp.

Result? ⚡ Fast writes. 🔒 Long SSD life.

## ⏱️ TTL & Memory Lifespan – Stay Lean, Stay Fast

Each Swamp can be configured to remain in memory for a specific amount of time *after* it was last accessed.

For example:

- Set it to just **1 second** if the Swamp should disappear almost immediately when not in use – ideal for small but frequently accessed states.
- Use **5 minutes** or longer if the Swamp contains a large amount of data – such as millions of records – and rehydrating it frequently would be inefficient. But think carefully before placing millions of records into a single Swamp. With HydrAIDE’s naming system, it’s often much more practical to split your data across multiple Swamps – either by time intervals, scopes, or logical groupings. This approach keeps your memory footprint low and your access speeds high.
- Set it to **zero** if the Swamp should unload instantly after it's used.

This allows HydrAIDE to model real-world data flows with remarkable precision:


- Some data is hot 🔥
- Some data is cold ❄️
- Some data just needs to pass through 💨

## 💥 Summary – One Line, Total Control

With just one line of code, you:

- Register a Swamp
- Control its persistence
- Define its write behavior
- Manage its RAM lifecycle
- Optimize its file size
- Keep your SSD healthy

No DSLs.
No YAML.
No DevOps.

Just beautiful, **developer-native control**.

And the best part?
You don’t need to be a data scientist, database architect, or DevOps wizard to do any of this.

All these decisions – like how long a dataset should stay in memory, how frequently it should write to disk, or whether it needs persistence at all – are part of your **business logic**.
And HydrAIDE gives you the power to express that logic **directly in code**, right where it belongs.

This means developers can finally **own the behavior of their data**, without waiting on infrastructure teams or battling config files.

HydrAIDE makes your data engine feel like an extension of your mind.

**Design your data. Define your behavior. Own your engine.**

Welcome to the Swamp Pattern. 🐊

## 🔗 SDK Integration Resources (Coming Soon)

We recommend that you explore HydrAIDE’s SDKs **only after** you understand the core philosophy and design principles.
This ensures that when you start writing code, it’s not just syntax – it’s intention.

Below is an overview of planned SDKs. Each will include dedicated documentation for the Swamp Pattern configuration:

| 💻 SDK | 🧪 Code Name | 🛠️ Status | 📘 Swamp Pattern Docs |
|--------|-------------|------------|-----------------------|
| 🟢 Go | [`hydraidego`](https://github.com/hydraide/hydraide/tree/main/docs/sdk/go/README.md) | ✅ Actively developed | Coming soon – Core SDK, battle-tested |
| 🟡 Node.js | `hydraidejs` | 🧪 In planning | Coming soon – Great for backend APIs |
| 🐍 Python | `hydraidepy` | 🧠 In design | Coming soon – Ideal for scripting/ML |
| 🦀 Rust | `hydraiders` | 🧠 In design | Coming soon – Performance critical apps |
| ☕ Java | `hydraidejv` | 🧠 In design | Coming soon – Enterprise integration |
| 🎯 C# / .NET | `hydraidecs` | 🧠 In design | Coming soon – Unity, backend services |
| 🧠 C++ | `hydraidecpp` | 🧠 In design | Coming soon – Low-level, native control |
| 🌀 Kotlin | `hydraidekt` | 🧠 In design | Coming soon – Android/backend devs |
| 🍎 Swift | `hydraidesw` | 🧠 In design | Coming soon – iOS/macOS native apps |

All SDKs will reflect the same core logic you just learned here – so once you understand the pattern, the implementation is just icing on the cake. 🍰

> 💬 **Not sure what kind of Swamp you need?**  
> Don’t worry – in future docs, we’ll walk you through common Swamp use cases *(real-time, archival, pub-sub, caching, etc.)* so you’ll know how to design your first HydrAIDE system like a pro.
