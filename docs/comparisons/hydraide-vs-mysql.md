## HydrAIDE vs MySQL

HydrAIDE is not a drop-in replacement for MySQL, it’s a **logic-native runtime** built for modern, reactive, distributed systems.
While MySQL is a venerable **SQL workhorse**, HydrAIDE is a **developer-native engine** that makes logic the structure, with no query layer at all.

MySQL was designed in the **1990s** for monolithic, transactional applications. It’s fast, battle-tested, and 
familiar, but not optimized for real-time, event-based, or embedded systems.

HydrAIDE is designed for:

* O(1) access without JOINs, indexes, or query parsing
* native subscriptions instead of polling
* filesystem-level partitioning (no query planner needed)
* full in-memory hydration on demand, zero idle overhead
* real-world developer models — structs, not schemas

MySQL asks you to define schemas, plan indexes, and learn SQL.
HydrAIDE says: “Just write the logic.”

### Bonus 🧪: Why MySQL is a relic of the past

Let’s be honest: MySQL was built for a world of **PHP + Apache + FTP**.
It’s fast, for *its time*. But that time was 2001. 😅

HydrAIDE isn’t “better MySQL.”
It’s a different world:

* 🚫 No tables
* 🚫 No joins
* 🚫 No query engine
* 🚫 No tuning

Just logic, structure, and state.
That’s how **modern developers** want to think. And that’s what HydrAIDE gives them.
