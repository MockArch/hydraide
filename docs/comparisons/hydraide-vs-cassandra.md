## HydrAIDE vs Cassandra

HydrAIDE is **not just another NoSQL database** - it’s a **logic-native data engine** that thinks and behaves 
like your application. In contrast, Cassandra is a distributed, disk-based key-value store that prioritizes 
throughput over developer alignment or runtime reactivity.

Cassandra excels at high-write scalability but comes with significant trade-offs: rigid data modeling, lack of 
native reactivity, manual indexing, and a steep operational learning curve.

When your system needs:

* fully reactive, **real-time behavior**,
* **zero-maintenance** indexing and cleanup,
* **safe concurrent** writes without eventual consistency delays,
* and **code-native**, intention-aligned development flow,

then HydrAIDE offers a fundamentally better developer experience, and faster results with **less infrastructure burden**.

HydrAIDE isn’t just simpler. It’s smarter and built for today’s apps, not yesterday’s storage paradigms.

## Feature comparison

| Feature                  | HydrAIDE                                       | Cassandra                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 🔍 Querying model        | ✅ Logic-structured via Swamps and Names        | ❌ Query-first; rigid schema per table      |
| 🧠 Memory-first design   | ✅ On-demand hydration, no idle CPU             | ❌ Always-on memory/disk activity           |
| 🔄 Built-in reactivity   | ✅ Native Subscribe() streams per key/swamp     | ❌ Requires external pub/sub (e.g. Kafka)   |
| ⚙️ Indexing              | ✅ Memory-based, zero-config, TTL-aware         | ❌ Requires manual schema/index design      |
| 🔐 Locking model         | ✅ Per-key, distributed lock without extra infra | ❌ No built-in locking — must be external   |
| 🧹 Cleanup               | ✅ Zero-waste: auto-GC of unused data           | ❌ Manual TTL + compaction + tuning         |
| 📦 Data storage          | ✅ Typed binary compact and fast          | ❌ Columnar text-based with tombstones      |
| 🌐 Scaling               | ✅ Stateless sharding via Swamp name            | ⚠️ Requires cluster planning and setup     |
| 🤖 Copilot compatibility | ✅ Fully Go-native structs                      | ⚠️ JSON-centric; limited schema reflection |
| 🧗 Learning curve        | 🟢 Zero-to-Hero in 1 day                       | 🔴 Steep: CQL, replication, consistency    |
| ⚡ Developer Experience   | ✅ Fully code-driven, no YAML/CLI needed        | ❌ DevOps-heavy, hard to test locally       |
| 🧰 CLI/UI required?      | ✅ Entirely optional                            | ❌ Required for schema, nodes, metrics      |
| 🐳 Install simplicity    | ✅ Single binary or Docker                      | ❌ Full cluster setup, JVM tuning, config   |

## Terminology Comparison

| ------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Swamp**     | Keyspace + Table     | A Swamp is a lightweight, name-based data unit. Created and managed via code, not config. | 🔹 Created dynamically <br> 🔹 Fully hydrated only on access <br> 🔹 Structure comes from naming |
| **Treasure**  | Row                  | Treasures are type-safe, binary entries. No schema migration or text-based overhead.      | 🔹 GOB-encoded structs <br> 🔹 Real-time events <br> 🔹 Optional metadata (createdAt, expireAt)  |
| **Key**       | Primary Key          | A tag in Go struct defines the unique identifier for each Treasure.                       | 🔹 Used for TTL, locks, slicing, indexing <br> 🔹 Safer than manual key constraints              |
| **Content**   | Columns              | In HydrAIDE, a Treasure contains a single value field — any struct.                    | 🔹 Strongly typed <br> 🔹 Struct logic is the model <br> 🔹 Compact binary storage               |
| **Hydra**     | Cassandra node       | Manages the Swamps and their hydration. Zero-idle runtime.                                | 🔹 Event-based <br> 🔹 File-based <br> 🔹 Zero idle or background load                           |
| **Zeus**      | OpsCenter / Admin    | Handles server lifecycle, health, recovery — via code, not GUI.                           | 🔹 No admin UI needed <br> 🔹 Works headlessly in CI/CD or edge nodes                            |
| **Island**    | Node / Datacenter    | A physical/memory shard in HydrAIDE, deterministically derived from Swamp name.           | 🔹 Name-based routing <br> 🔹 No cluster metadata <br> 🔹 Ideal for dynamic horizontal scaling   |
| **Beacon**    | Secondary Index      | In-memory, reactive indexes used for filtering and scanning inside Swamps.                | 🔹 Auto-created per field <br> 🔹 No disk writes <br> 🔹 TTL-aligned and GC’d                    |
