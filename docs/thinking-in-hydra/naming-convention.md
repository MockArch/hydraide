# 📛 Naming Convention – Your First Step into Hydra Thinking

Welcome to Hydra! 👋

We’re genuinely thrilled to have you here.
Whether you're a seasoned backend developer or just curious about how modern data systems work, what you're about to learn will fundamentally change the way you *think* about data.

Hydra is not just another tool.
It's a mindset.
And this – the way you *name* things – is where the transformation begins.

## 🧬 Before We Dive In: Meet Hydra

Imagine Hydra as a powerful guardian rising from the swamp of unstructured data.
It doesn't just store your data — it **protects** it, **organizes** it, and makes it **instantly accessible**.

Think of Hydra as your engine.
Think of the *Swamp* as your storage.
And think of a *Treasure* as the smallest unit inside the swamp — a single piece of meaningful data.

But Hydra doesn’t stop at storage. It gives you two extra layers to help you keep everything clean, organized, and beautifully structured:

1. **Sanctuary** – the highest layer; a place of intention.
2. **Realm** – the middle layer; a world within the sanctuary.
3. **Swamp** – the base; a specific dataset or object-space.

That’s the full address of your data.
You don’t just dump information somewhere – you **place** it, with meaning.

## 🧠 The Hydra Way of Thinking

Let’s unlearn what traditional databases taught us.
Forget massive tables with millions of rows.
Forget universal collections where every user lives in the same pile.

In Hydra, **every Swamp is a domain.**
Each Swamp deserves its own name.
Each Swamp lives in its own folder on disk.
And because of that, **Hydra can access any Swamp in O(1) time.**

That’s not just fast – that’s instant.

So instead of asking:

> *Where can I find this data?*

You’ll start asking:

> *What is the exact name of the Swamp that holds this data?*

This simple mental shift unlocks Hydra’s true power.

## 🏗️ Real-World Example – User Profiles

Let’s say you’re building a system with user accounts.
Instead of one giant “users” table with 1M rows, you create **one Swamp per user**.

- Sanctuary: `users`
- Realm: `profiles`
- Swamp: `petergebri`

In traditional terms, this would be like having a separate database or table for each user.
Sounds crazy?
Not when every Swamp is instantly reachable by name.

This is how we make **hydration** real-time.
When `Swamp('petergebri')` is requested, that data is loaded immediately into memory – no scan, no lookup, just pure direct access.

> 🔍 **But wait – does that mean it's always in memory?**
>
> Not quite. Swamps live on disk until you call them. But because each Swamp is small and precisely scoped – and because Hydra stores them as individual folders – loading one is extremely fast. On modern SSDs, this is measured in **milliseconds**.
>
> There’s no query planner, no full-table scan. Just:
>
> **Name → Disk → Memory → Done.**
>
> That’s not caching. That’s not traditional I/O. That’s **precision memory loading.**
>
> And it feels like magic.

## 🔑 Swamps as Keyed Spaces

Now think of a Swamp not just as a folder, but as a **keyed treasure vault**.
Inside, each Treasure is a key-value pair. Sometimes it's just the key.

For example:
You want to store all registered user IDs.
Create a Swamp where each key is a user ID. That’s it.
No metadata, no joins, no fluff.

You now have a blazing-fast Swamp that shows you exactly who registered – without storing anything more than needed.

---

## 🧘 Naming with Intention

Because every Swamp matters, naming becomes sacred.

- Names should be **unique** per entity.
- Names should be **human-readable**.
- Names should express **intent**.

Let’s go further:
You want to store every user’s product wishlist.
Don’t build a table called `wishlists`.
Instead, create a Swamp like:

```text
Sanctuary('users')
  ↳ Realm('wishlists')
    ↳ Swamp('petergebri')
```

Hydra doesn’t ask: *Which row is Peter in?*
It asks: *What’s Peter’s wishlist?* And it gives it to you. Instantly.



> 🧩 **How do you create a Swamp?**
>
> It’s simple: the **very first time** you refer to a Swamp and write data into it, Hydra **automatically creates it** based on the naming pattern used in your code.
>
> No need for manual setup. No need to declare schemas or define anything in advance.
>
> (More on this later – but yes, it's that seamless.)

## 🧪 What is Hydration?

In Hydra, we use a special term for the moment a Swamp becomes active in memory:

> **Hydration**.

Hydration refers to the exact moment when a Swamp – which previously only existed on disk – is loaded into memory, becomes alive, and instantly usable by your code.

This isn’t caching. This isn’t preloading. This is **name-based direct memory access**, powered by ultra-fast SSDs and Hydra’s folder-based storage model.

So no, the Swamp isn’t sitting in RAM all the time. But when you name it, **Hydra knows exactly where to find it**, and brings it to life in milliseconds.

That’s why Hydra isn’t just fast. Hydra **feels what you summon by name.**

---

## 🧭 Final Thoughts

In Hydra, the way you name your Swamps defines how you think about structure.
Names aren’t just labels – they’re **addresses**, **permissions**, and **portals to memory**.

This is the beginning of your Hydra journey.
Think of this not as naming convention, but **naming intention**.

Hydra isn’t just here to store your data.
It’s here to help you make sense of it.
And that clarity starts with the names you give.

Let’s go deeper.

## 🔗 SDK Integration Resources (Coming Soon)

Now that you've explored the **naming convention**, you're ready to glimpse what's coming next: **Hydra SDKs**.

But here’s our advice:
Explore these SDKs **only after** you’ve fully embraced how Swamps are structured and named. When you name with intention, code becomes an extension of thought – not just syntax.

Each SDK will support the naming patterns you’ve just learned, making it easy to apply your new Hydra mindset directly into your favorite language.

| 💻 SDK | 🧪 Code Name | 🛠️ Status | 📘 Swamp Pattern Docs |
|--------|-------------|------------|-----------------------|
| 🟢 Go | `hydrungo` | ✅ Actively developed | Coming soon – Core SDK, battle-tested |
| 🟡 Node.js | `hydrunjs` | 🧪 In planning | Coming soon – Great for backend APIs |
| 🐍 Python | `hydrunpy` | 🧠 In design | Coming soon – Ideal for scripting/ML |
| 🦀 Rust | `hydrunrs` | 🧠 In design | Coming soon – Performance critical apps |
| ☕ Java | `hydrunjv` | 🧠 In design | Coming soon – Enterprise integration |
| 🎯 C# / .NET | `hydruncs` | 🧠 In design | Coming soon – Unity, backend services |
| 🧠 C++ | `hydruncpp` | 🧠 In design | Coming soon – Low-level, native control |
| 🌀 Kotlin | `hydrunkt` | 🧠 In design | Coming soon – Android/backend devs |
| 🍎 Swift | `hydrunsw` | 🧠 In design | Coming soon – iOS/macOS native apps |

All SDKs will follow the same core logic – so once you understand Swamp naming, applying it in Go, Python, JavaScript, or any other language will feel completely natural.

> 💬 **Still unsure about how naming patterns work in your context?**  
> Don’t worry. In the next chapters, we’ll guide you step by step through how to store and read data, how to model your Swamps, and how it all connects in code.

Let’s keep going. 🚀
