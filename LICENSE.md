# HydrAIDE SDK ‚Äì License Overview (Human‚ÄëFriendly)

Our goal is to make **HydrAIDE accessible to as many people as possible** we‚Äôd be thrilled  
to see it used in everything from tiny hobby projects to large-scale enterprise systems.

At the same time, the HydrAIDE Core is the result of years of work, design, and custom development.  
We want to protect it from those who would simply copy it and resell it as their own service.

## ü§ù That‚Äôs why the system uses a **dual license model**

This means that two layers of the system are licensed under different terms:

### üß© 1. **HydrAIDE SDK** ‚Äì LGPL v3

This is what you see here on GitHub, free to download and use.  
The SDK helps connect your own system to the HydrAIDE Core.

**You can use it freely** if:
- you‚Äôre integrating it into your own application, internal tool, or product,
- your app is open-source or closed-source, both are allowed,
- you‚Äôre building a commercial product, client-facing tool, or an API that uses the SDK.

**What we ask**: if you modify the SDK itself, please publish those changes (that‚Äôs the essence of LGPL).

### üîê 2. **HydrAIDE Core** - SSPL v1 (with custom clauses)

This is the engine behind the search, segmentation, GRPC communication, and more.

**You can use the Core freely** if:
- you embed it in your own system, even at enterprise scale,
- you **don‚Äôt resell or expose the HydrAIDE Core itself** as a standalone service or rebranded product.

**You need a commercial license** if:
- you offer a public service where HydrAIDE‚Äôs functionality is the main value,
  - e.g. a search API, a hosted database-as-a-service, or an engine rebranded under your own name;
- or you repackage HydrAIDE as your own product ("white-labeling").

---

## ‚úÖ Examples where free use is allowed

- You‚Äôre building a CRM where HydrAIDE powers internal search, but you don‚Äôt expose that as a standalone database service.
- You‚Äôre building a dashboard for your clients where HydrAIDE is used behind the scenes.
- You‚Äôre creating a SaaS product, but HydrAIDE is neither visible, nor accessible, nor the main value of your platform.

---

## ‚ùå Examples where a commercial license is required

- You offer a public API where HydrAIDE is the core engine and its features are what you're selling.
- You build and sell an analytics platform that relies on HydrAIDE for segmentation and this is a key selling point.
- You clone HydrAIDE‚Äôs functionality and sell it under your own name.

üëâ In short: if your product or service **is built around HydrAIDE Core**,  
or you offer it as a **standalone product or public service**, you need a commercial license.
